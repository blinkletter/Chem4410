# Lesson 10: Student Exploration
We will explore some literature examples that I have prepared as guides for a student exporation of a topic relevant to physical organic chemistry. As you examine these, you will see what you might do to dive deep into a publication or series of publications that uses the methods of this course to investigate a chemical problem.

## 10.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class â€“ it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- Commentary on the literature part 1
    - Is there life **after** the transition state?
    - We will examine a body of work that **argues** that a reaction can change its destiniy after the transition state. This goes **against the dogma** of transition state theory. Is this **heresey**?
- Commentary on the literature part 2
    - **Three** parameter LFER plots. Have they gone **too far**?
    - We will examine a body or work where a three parameter plot is used in **LFER analysis** of a reaction.
    - There is extensive kinetic and pH rate profile **data to mine** here. We will analyze the data from the **supplementary material** and see if we agree with the conclusions.

 


## 10.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested material and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

- Be able to **search** the primary literature
- **Interpret** methods and results in primary literature
- **Apply** your understanding of ((physical organic chemistry)) to interpret the arguments and conclusions in a literature contribution.
- Know how to access **additional data** and information in suplementary material
- Have the **confidence** to disagree with the authors and the **humility** to accept if they are correct after investigating (and the **courage** to stick to your guns if you are right)
- **Write** a document summarizing and interpreting a series of publications.
- Use **data analysis** tools to confirm or criticize conclusions in a paper and **document** your analysis using *Jupyter* notebooks.

## 10.3 Assignment \#10

The following assignment is to be submitted via moodle before the Friday meeting.

### The Instructions

This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following&hellip;

> Choose the topic from the three proposed ideas or a complete new topic.

### The Deliverable

> A written proposal and plan as well as an initial publication.

### Grading

**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems: [write some questions]

### Friday

In our third meeting for this lesson there will be a **short quiz** featuring problems adapted from the suggested textbook problems for lessons 7, 8 and 9. After the presentations, we will then discuss the student exploration assignment. Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 11 to see what you should prepare for Monday. 

#### Presentations

> Two of you will have been selected on Monday to present the your proposed topics for the student exporation. be sure to justify you decision in choosing these topics. Sell you idea to your peers.
