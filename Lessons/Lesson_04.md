# Lesson 4: Thermochemistry and Strain

Let us use math again to interpret chemistry. Over the last century chemists have established **detailed tables** of data for burning hydrocarbons and used this information to establish the **heats of formation**, &Delta;*H<sub>f</sub>*&deg;. Along the way, it was observed that certain **groups contributed** the same portion of &Delta;*H<sub>f</sub>*&deg;. These became known as **group increments** and represent the contribution of a chemical group in an unstrained system. We might experimentaly measure the &Delta;*H<sub>f</sub>*&deg; for a molecule and observe that it is significantly **different** than that calculated using a collection of group increments. This difference in energy is most often the result of **strain**.

## 4.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- Using known **bond dissociation energies** to predict stability and predict the thermochemistry of a reaction. (Ch. 2.1)
- Using tables of **group increments** to calculate the difference in enthalpy between reactants and products and between reactants, high-energy intermediates and products. (Ch. 2.2)
- Identifying and classifying **conformers** in alkanes and cycloalkanes. Using tables of steric ”**A-values**” to predict populations of conformers in these cases. (Ch. 2.3) 
- **Electronic effects vs. steric effects** and the example of the anomeric effect (Ch. 2.4)
- All calculations will be demonstrated in the class meeting using Jupyter notebooks and **Python** as the calculator.

## 4.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

- Interpret the **steric strain** present in a molecule by examining its conformation.
- Predict the **enthalpy change** for a reaction using group increments.
- Use experimental enthalpy changes and calculated enthalpy changes to estimate steric strain and **resonance stabilization**.

## 4.3 Assignment \#4

The following assignment is to be submitted via moodle **before** Friday (there is **no meeting** this friday).

### The Instructions
This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following&hellip;

> **Make a plot** of the IR stretching frequencies for covalent bonds vs. the corresponding bond dissociation energies. Does IR stretching frequency **correlate** with a measure of bond strength? Use a spreadsheet program or Jupyter notebook for creating the graph. 

### The Deliverable
> **Comment** on your observations. **Write** the document in a clear and concise style using a word processor or other document creation system. **Document** your activities (where did you get the data, how did you analyze it, what tools did you use? **Include** the data table and the plot, of course. 

### Grading

**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.

## 4.4 Lesson Schedule

### Monday 

We will use **group increments** to determine the heats of formation of a number of hydrocarbons and compare the calculated values with experimental observations. Using this information we will calculate the **strain energy** in the molecules. Can the strain energy be explained?

#### Reading

> **Read** Chapter 2.1 to 2.3  

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems at the end of Chapter 2: 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \& 51 <br>
> Use **GAMESS** to optimize the structure of hydrazine (problem 11) and compare the calculated result with your proposed conformation.

### Wednesday

**Group increments** and bond dissociation energies can be used to **interpret reactions** and make predictions. Can we identifty the stabilization that **aromaticity** brings above and beyond mere conjugation. Three bonds in a row seem to have very different properties when arranged in a circle. Why?

**Look ahead** to Lesson 5 to see what you should prepare for Monday.

#### Reading

> **Read** Chapter 2.4  

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems at the end of Chapter 2: 15, 25, 26, 36, 41 & 50 <br>
> **Attempt** to use **Avogadro** to obtain the optimized structures and energies for methylcyclohexane in both the axial and equatorial conformations. Do the results agree with the observed A-values?

### Friday

No Classes. **Truth & Reconcilliation Day** but it's not a holliday. Time to do the work.

#### Reading

> **Read** [Where are the Children Buried?](https://ehprnh2mwo3.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AAA-Hamilton-cemetery-FInal.pdf). Available on the **National Centre of Truth and Reconcilliation** [website](https://nctr.ca/).
