# Lesson 9: Catalysis

Lots of things want to happen but are just **too slow** to matter. Ethyl acetate and water are lower in energy if they combine to become acetic acid and ethanol. However you can boil a mixture of ethyl acetate and water all day and **no product** will be detected. However, add a touch of sodium hydroxide and the reaction will **proceed readily**. The reaction is faster because of a **catalyst**. All alkenes will combine with hydrogen to become alkanes, but will never react without a catalysts (at least not in your lifetime.) **Glycolysis** is downhill in energy but nothing will happen without the enzyme catalsyts. Catalysis is very important. it is the great **enabler** of industrial chemistry and **life** itself.

## 9.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- Definitions in **catalysis** (Ch. 9.1, 9.2)
- Reaction **kinetics** with catalysis
    - Example of the famous **Michael-Menten** equation
- Definition of **acid and base catalysis** 
    - **Specific** acid/base catalysis
    - **General** acid/base catalysis
    - **Rate laws** in complex reaction schemes involving acid/base catalysis (Ch. 9.3)
    - Interpreting **pH rate profiles**. (Ch. 9.3) 
    - The Brönsted plot (Chapter 8.5)
- Examples of **enzyme catalysis** (Ch. 9.4) 

## 9.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

- Describe the various ways that a reaction can be **catalyzed** and understand how the reaction coordinate is changed with catalysis.
- Construct a **rate law** for a catalyzed reaction.
- Understand the difference between **specific and general** acid/base catalysis.
     - Describe the difference in rate-determining step and the structure of the transition state in each case.
    - Construct rate laws for specific and general acid/base catalysis and be able to interpret reaction kinetics to confirm the rate law.
- Understand the Brønsted relationship in acid/base catalysis and how **Brønsted plots** can be used to investigate acid/base catalyzed reactions.
- Interpret the structure of an **active site** in an enzyme and explain the various **catalytic strategies** that are being exploited in the active site.
    - Understand the meanings of the Michaelis-Menten **parameters** *K<sub>M</sub>* , *k<sub>cat</sub>* and *k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>*.
- Understand the uses of Taft **steric parameters** in quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and how QSAR is used to **investigate** enzyme active sites and **develop** new drugs.
- Apply relevant methods from chapters 7 and 8 in interpreting **enzyme mechanisms**.

## 9.3 Assignment \#9

The following assignment is to be submitted via moodle before the Friday meeting.

### The Instructions
This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following&hellip;

> Ph rate profile assignment

> Choose 3 topics and sample papers for starting your student exploration.

### The Deliverable

> Ph rate profile assignment

> Choose 3 topics and sample papers for starting your student exploration.

### Grading

**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.

### Looking Ahead to the Big One

Each week has an **assignment** associated with it but now you will be working on **two** assignments in the remaining weeks. There will be the **weekly project** and there will be a single **longer project** that will continue until the end of the course. There will still be only a single assignment **due each week** but you will want to start this larger capstone assignment early.

The next lesson will have an **assignment** where you examine an exploration of a literature topic that I have prepared. You will also choose **three topics** for your own exploration. Choose a topic that you have some **interest** in and apply the principles of **physical organic chemistry** as you investigate the primarty literature. Do not pick a topic and then figure out it doesn't suit your plans two weeks from now.  You need to do preliminary work **early**.  Choose three topics and look into them and choose the best one for you.

You will see that this weeks assignment includes finding three topics and initial  **literature examples**. Who knows where you will end up, but you must **start now**.
