    "# Lesson 2: Molecular Structure\n",
    "What holds the world together? **Chemical bonds**. What are they? They are not lines or dots, they are an arrangement of electrons and nuclei that are lower in energy than other options. Let us explore what bonds really are by considering the inner electronic life of a molecule.\n",

    "## 2.1 Lesson Plan\n",
    "The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas$\\ldots$\n",
    "- **Electronic structure**in molecules: Lewis structure and VSEPR theory \n",
    "- **Hybrid orbitals**, $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ bonds and resonance\n",
    "- Constructing **Molecular orbitals** (the textbook presents a fairly complicated method for building accurate molecular orbitals using hybrid orbitals in Ch. 1.2. I will be presenting a simpler method that produces much less accurate but equally useful molecular orbitals for interpreting reactivity). \n",
    "- We will **construct molecular orbitals** for alkenes, ketones and enolates and discuss how the shape and size of the orbitals directs reactivity. **See the Molecular Orbital Tutorial** described in the resources section below and available on the Moodle site.\n",
    "- We will then explore how molecular orbital theory revelas details that Lewis structure cannot and explore this idea using **Hückel Molecular orbital theory (HMOT)**.\n",
    "    - Interpreting the reactivity of an alkene and a carbonyl group to electrophiles and nucleophiles\n",
    "    - Using Huckel molecular orbital theory (HMOT) to investigate the properties of conjugated and aromatic MO systems.\n",
    "    - Using python and computational tools to calculate results of HMOT.\n",

    "- Understand how **hydrid orbitals** are constructed from atomic orbitals according to bond angles.\n",
    "- Calculate the **hydridization** of a carbon atom from bond angles and use this information to **interpret electronic structure**.\n",

    "### Monday \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with a discussion of Lewis structure and how it is surprisingly effective in approximating the information available from more sophisticated local molecular orbital (LMO) approaches (LMO). We will then review molecular orbital theory and construct a molecular orbital diagram using the LMO method. How does arrow pushing and Lewis structures relate to the molecular orbital diagrams of reactants and products?\n",
