    "# Lesson 4: Thermochemistry and Strain\n",
    "Let us use math again to interpret chemistry. Over the last century chemists have established **detailed tables** of data for burning hydrocarbons and used this information to establish the **heats of formation**, $\\Delta H_f^{\\circ}$. Along the way, it was observed that certain **groups contributed** the same portion of $\\Delta H_f^{\\circ}$. These became known as **group increments** and represent the contribution of a chemical group in a completely unstrained system. We might know the $\\Delta H_f^{\\circ}$ for a molecule and observe that it is significantly **different** than that calculated using a collection of group increments. This difference in energy is most often the result of **strain**.\n",

    "## 4.1 Lesson Plan\n",
    "The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using known **bond dissociation energies** to predict stability and predict the thermochemistry of a reaction. (Ch. 2.1)\n",
    "- Using tables of **group increments** to calculate the difference in enthalpy between reactants and products and between reactants, high-energy intermediates and products. (Ch. 2.2)\n",
    "- Identifying and classifying **conformers** in alkanes and cycloalkanes. Using tables of steric ”**A-values**” to predict populations of conformers in these cases. (Ch. 2.3) \n",
    "- **Electronic effects vs. steric effects** and the example of the anomeric effect (Ch. 2.4)\n",
    "- All calculations will be demonstrated in the class meeting using Jupyter notebooks and **Python** as the calculator.\n",

    "-----\n",
    "## 4.2 Learning Goals\n",
    "After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpret the **steric strain** present in a molecule by examining its conformation.\n",
    "- Predict the **enthalpy change** for a reaction using group increments.\n",
    "- Use experimental enthalpy changes and calculated enthalpy changes to estimate steric strain and **resonance stabilization**.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Make a plot** of the IR stretching frequencies for covalent bonds vs. the corresponding bond dissociation energies. Does IR stretching frequency **correlate** with a measure of bond strength? Use a spreadsheet program or Jupyter notebook for creating the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Report\n",
    "> **Comment** on your observations. **Write** the document in a clear and concise style using a word processor or other document creation system. **Document** your activities (where did you get the data, how did you analyze it, what tools did you use? **Include** the data table and the plot, of course. \n",

    "### Grading\n",
