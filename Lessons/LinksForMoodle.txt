LESSON 1

1. [Textbook Table of Contents](https://uscibooks.aip.org/wp-content/uploads/adfm_new.pdf)
      - This is the front matter from the textbook.
2. [Organic Chemistry Review](http://sites.tufts.edu/andrewrosen/files/2012/11/Orgo-I-Overview1.pdf)
      - I found this set of review slides at Tufts University. It is a concise list including most of the reactions that you explored in Chem 2410/2420/3420. Perhaps it will be helpful.
3. [Arrow Pushing](http://iverson.cm.utexas.edu/courses/310N/Mechanism%20Sheets/MechanismExplanation.pdf)
      - From the University of Texas I found this brief overview of arrow pushing as a way to express reaction mechanism.
4. [Organic Chemistry Mechanisms](http://higheredbcs.wiley.com/legacy/college/spencer/047165552X/modules/mod6.pdf)
      - This is a link to a module of an out-of-print textbook from Wiley.
5. [Hybrid Orbitals and Bonding](http://www.cpp.edu/~psbeauchamp/pdf/314_lect_02.pdf) 
      - This is an overview of hybrid orbitals and bonding from Cal Poly Pomona. 
6. [More Arrow Pushing](https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/clc/organic/343/03_electron_pushing_343.pdf)
      - Another take on arrow pushing in organic chemical mechanisms from the University of Wisconsin. 
7. [Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry](https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/intro1.htm) 
      - This is a link to the free textbook by William Reusch. It is a serviceable overview of organic chemistry and it is free. 
8. [Organic Chemistry Mechanism Problems with Answers](https://github.com/blinkletter/Chem4410/blob/main/Lessons/Lesson_01/practice_e12-S.Cortes.pdf) 
      - This is a set of problems curated by Sergio Cortes of the University of Texas at Dallas. Try them out before checking the answers.
9. [Organic Chemistry Review](https://github.com/blinkletter/Chem4410/blob/main/Lessons/Lesson_01/01-Review_of_Selected_Topics_in_Organic_Chemistry.pdf) 
      - I wrote this as a review of organic chemistry for students who are beginning my biochemistry course.
10. [Review of Organic Chemistry: Nucleophilic Carbon](https://github.com/blinkletter/Chem4410/blob/main/Lessons/Lesson_01/02-Nucleophilic_Carbon.pdf) 
      - I wrote this as a supple- ment for my advanced organic chemistry course as a review of enolate chemistry. It is brief and not very comprehensive but may be helpful. 
11. [Summary of Organic Chemistry](https://github.com/blinkletter/Chem4410/blob/main/Lessons/Lesson_01/36-Chemistry%20243%20Review.pdf) 
      - I started writing this as an overview of Or- ganic Chemistry for Life Sciences, Chem 243. It was never finished but what is there may be helpful. 
12. [A Chemistry Toolkit](https://github.com/blinkletter/Chem4410/blob/main/Lessons/Lesson_01/01-30-Chem_112_Toolkit%20copy.pdf)
      - I wrote this as a review of introductory chemistry for my beginning organic chjemistry students. Itâ€™s been a long time since your first year. How much do you recall?
