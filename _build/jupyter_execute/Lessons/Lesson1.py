# # Lesson 1: Remembering The Past
# Life is about **making** things and **breaking** things, mostly chemical bonds. All of the reactions of the famous **glycolysis** pathway can be understood using organic chemistry. A deeper understanding of **physical organic chemistry** will enable you to interpret how **enzymes** provide the catalysis that enable the pathway to operate at the speed needed to be meaniful in providing **energy** for cells. Let us embark on our journey to greater understanding of all chemical reactions that make and break bonds by **reviewing** a small slice of our **previous experience**.
# 
# Our first two meetings will focus on reviewing organic chemistry.  
# 
# 
# ## Wednesday
# In our first meeting you will be asked to **propose a mechanism** for the hydrolysis of t-butyl bromide in acidic water, for the elimination reaction of t-butyl bromide in basic water, and for the hydrolysis of methyl acetate in both acidic and basic water. Your challenge will be to not only propose the **correct** mechanism, but to propose **every possible** mechanism. Then **evaluate** each mechanism and **explain** why you think each may be unlikely or likely to contribute to the observed rate of the reaction. You will leave the meeting with a handout of reactions to review for Friday.
# 
# ### Reading
# There is no reading to do in advance of starting the course however you will want to very quickly **review appendix 5 of the textbook** and try the problems you see there.
# 
# > **Read** appendix 5 of textbook (pages 1061 to 1074)<br>
# > **Read** appendix 6 (pages 1075 to 1077)
# 
# ### Suggested Problems
# During our first meeting we will attempt a few selections the following problems in from appendix 5. You should attempt all of them on your own after the class.
# 
# > **Problems**: Appendix 5 - 1, 2, 3 & 4
# 
# ### Resources
# You may find the following resources useful as you explore the ideas for todays meeting.
# 
#  1. Organic Chemistry Review
#       - I wrote this as a review of organic chemistry for students who are beginning my biochemistry course. 
#  2. Review of Organic Chemistry: Nucleophilic carbon
#       - I wrote this as a supplement for my advanced organic chemistry course as a review of enolate chemistry. It is brief and not very comprehensive but may be helpful. 
#  3. Summary of Organic Chemistry

#  5. Organic Chemistry Mechanism Problems with Answers
#        - This is a set of probems curated by Sergio Cortes of the University of Texas at Dallas (Go Comets!). Try them out before checking the answers.
# 
# ## Friday
# In our second meeting there will be a **short quiz** featuring a few of the reactions that you were given to review. We will **discuss** the problems suggested previously from appendix 5. be prepared to contribute. We will try to define what is meant by the words "physical organic chemsitry" and I will also introduce my vision of wrapping the activities of this course around computer tools. Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 2 to see what you should prepare for Monday. 
# 
# ### Reading
# 
# For this second meeting in the course I would like you to **come prepared** to discuss the idea of "what is physical organic chemistry?" In preparation please complete the following reading.
# >  **Read** the preface of your textbook (pages xxiii to xxiv) <br>
# >  **Read** "Physical-Organic Chemistry: A Swiss Army Knife." G.M. Whitesides, *Isr. J. Chem.*, **2016**, *56*, 66-82. https://doi-org.proxy.library.upei.ca/10.1002/ijch.201500061
# 
# ### Links to Journals
# I will only ask you to read journal articles to which UPEI has **subscription access**. However, you may find these lins only work on campus. So you will want to **plan ahead** and download any journal articles while you are on campus.
# 
# ### Resources

# Resources
# The Moodle page contains links to helpful documents that I have prepared to support this class meeting. They include...
# Lesson Plan
# Arrow pushing in conjugated systems (A5.3)
# Inductive vs. resonance for electronic effects Stabilization of carbanions and carbocations by resonance
# Arrow pushing rules and don’ts (A5.4)

#  Learning Goals
# After reviewing your organic chemistry you should be able predict the hybridization of carbon atoms and be able to identify resonance contributors that stabilize electronic structure in conjugated systems. You should be able to evaluate relative stability of related molecules by examining their electronic structure. You should be able to make a reasonable proposal for the mechanism of unfamiliar reactions using the rules of Lewis structure, your understanding of resonance and arrow pushing to express electron movement.
# Assignment #1
# Due Date
# To be handed in at the next class meeting.
# Instructions.
# Review your organic chemistry. Do ALL the problems at the end of Appendix 5. Hand in a document where you answer questions 2C, 2E, 3B, 3E and 3H. Follow the instructions for the questions. Neatly present the reaction mechanisms as instructed by the textbook using arrows to denote electron movement. Your answers may disagree with the accepted mechanism but must be reasonable (you may be wrong, but you may not break the rules).
# Grading
# Half of the grade will be for your answer and half will evaluate how neat, clear and professional your chemical drawings are. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program or to hand draw the answers but be neat and clear.
# A Note on the “Boss Quality Document” initiative.
# In this course you are not only exploring advanced topics in chemistry and mastering your chemical instincts, you are preparing to depart from the cocoon and spread your wings in the wide world. It is time to pay attention to details that are more important in the real world than they are here. One of these is the impression that your work gives to those who receive it. It is not enough to be correct, you need to effectively communicate with others. Whether you are writing a document for your first boss or your early investors, you will need to be clear and easily understood. The quality of your writing and the appearance of your work are going to matter. Presenting sloppy work shows a lack of respect for the people who are receiving it.
# Give me a final draft in pen and ink (or a printout), not a first draft in pencil on tattered paper that has been erased many times. Throughout this course I will be emphasizing the quality of your work as well as your understanding of the subject. People will forgive your mistakes, but sloppy work will forever define you in the eyes of others. First impressions matter in every aspect of life. Don’t let the first impression of your work be a poor one. And remember – nothing says “class” quite like a staple in the corner.
