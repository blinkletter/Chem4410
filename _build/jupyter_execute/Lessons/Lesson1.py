# # Lesson 1: Remembering The Past
# Life is about **making** things and **breaking** things, mostly chemical bonds. All of the reactions of the famous **glycolysis** pathway can be understood using organic chemistry. A deeper understanding of **physical organic chemistry** will enable you to interpret how **enzymes** provide the catalysis that enable the pathway to operate at the speed needed to be meaniful in providing **energy** for cells. Let us embark on our journey to greater understanding of all chemical reactions that make and break bonds by **reviewing** a small slice of our **previous experience**.
# 
# Our first two meetings will focus on reviewing organic chemistry.  
# 
# ## How to Use a Lesson
# 
# We begin the first week with our first lesson. **Each week** is organized as a **lesson** in an aspect of physical organic chemistry. Each lesson document will contain the **lesson plan and learning goals** for the week. This will be followed by a description of the **assignment** due at the end of the week. Then there will be a schedule of **readings and suggested problems** for each day of the week. The lesson will end with a list of **resources** (if any) that are available on the course moodle page. Follow along with the lesson below and find all of these elements for yourself.
# 
# ----
# ## 1.1 Lesson Plan  
# 
# The lesson plans presented in this document are the **ideas** that I hope to explore over the **week** of a given lesson. The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. If we **miss** some of these points I suggest that you **read** about those ideas in the textbook, whether we discuss them in class or not.
# 
# - **Arrow pushing** for. . .
#     - $S_N2$ substitution in amine synthesis: propylamine + bromobutane 
#     - $E2$ elimination of bromobutane by propylamine
#     - $S_N1$ solvolysis of t-butyl bromide
#     - $E1$ elimination in t-butyl bromide
# - Arrow pushing rules: **do and don’ts**
#     - Wrong way arrows
#     - Octet rule (keep track of bonds to hydrogen and lone pairs)
#     - Bad habits with electrons (lone pairs are the nucleophile, etc...)
#     - Are you in acid or base? Pick one and stay there!
#     - Common shortcuts that we will NOT be using in this course.
# - Arrow pushing in **conjugated systems**
#     - Inductive vs. resonance for electronic effects 
#     - Stabilization of carbanions and carbocations by resonance
# - Mechanism **puzzles**
#     - Why do we observe solvolysis of *t*-butyl bromide but not in *n*-butyl bromide?
#     - Base hydrolysis of ester, acid hydrolysis of ester (acyl substitution)
#     - Formation of imine compared with formation of hydrazone
#     - Introduce idea of difference in equilibrium for these two reactions.
#     - Hydrolysis of enamine
# 
#     
# ## 1.2 Learning Goals
# After **reading** the suggested textbook section, **practicing** the problems and completing the activities of the **assignment** you should be able to$\ldots$
# 
# - **Name** simple molecules, identify **stereochemistry**, predict products of addition, elimination and substitution (simple, acyl and aromatic) reactions.
# - Propose the **synthesis** of simple molecules using carbon nucleophiles and functional group transformations.
# - Express the **mechanism** of these reactions using curved arrows to show electron movement.
# - Identify the **hybridization** of carbon atoms and be able to identify **resonance** contributors that stabilize electronic structure in conjugated systems.
# - Evaluate relative **stability** of related molecules by examining their **electronic structure**.
# - Make a reasonable **proposal** for the mechanism of unfamiliar reactions using the **rules** of Lewis structure, your understanding of resonance and arrow pushing to express electron movement.
# 
# 
# ----
# ## 1.3 Assignment
# Each lesson has an assignment. It will be introduced on the Friday before the lesson and will be due on the Friday of the lesson. Our first week is short so the assignment is small. It is to be handed in Friday before class meeting via moodle. 
# 
# ### Instructions
# This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following$\ldots$
# > **Review** your organic chemistry. <br>
# > **Answer** questions 2C, 2E, 3B, 3E and 3H at the end of appendix 5.
# 
# ### The Report
# This section describes the **deliverable** that you are to produce for this assignment. 
# 
# 
# > **Write** a report that answers a single question from the list in the instructions above. Each student will have an individual question assigned for the report.  Your report will present the **step-by-step mechanism** for the given reaction with electron flow shown using arrows. It will likely be a single page when finished. Give it a title and be sure that your name is under the title. **Justify** any choices you made with brief arguments. Use professional tools (chemical drawing program, word processor, etc.) and submit the document in **PDF format**.
# 
# Use the **table below** to match the **last digit** of your student number to the **problem** that you are to present in your report. Even though you prepared just one answer from the data set, you are expected to **be able to discuss** any of the problems (you did attempt them all, didn’t you?).
# 
# | Digit  | Problem |Digit  | Problem |
# | :----: | :-----: |:----: | :-----: |
# | 0      |   2C    |  5    | 2C      |
# | 1      |   2E    |  6    | 2E      |
# | 2      |   3B    |  7    | 3B      |
# | 3      |   3E    |  8    | 3E      |
# | 4      |   3H    |  9    | 3H      |
#      
# ### Grading
# Half of the grade will be for your **answer** and half will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your work is. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program.
# 
# #### A Note About Deliverables
# The deliverable is what you ”deliver” to your instructor. Quite often **assignments** will have many questions to answer, but each individual student will be assigned a subset of those questions to include in a **report**. Always **read the instructions** and deliverable sections carefully. These detail what I want you to do and what I want you to hand in to me. Use this information to give me what I want - the customer is always right.
# 
# The report that you submit should be prepared **using a computer**. All structures presented should be made using a **chemical drawing program** such as Chemdraw, Chemsketch or Marvin. All of those programs can give you the curved arrows needed to express electron flow. Strive to make it look professional.
# 
# Submit your report via Moodle. All assignment reports can be submitted using the corresponding link that will be present in the Moodle page. Click on the link and follow the instructions to submit your report. Only **PDF files** will be accepted.
# 
# In the modern world, documents are exchanged electronically. Printing is unnecessary and wasteful. Please create a **PDF file** containing your report. Use a word processor to create a document with a **title** and **author** and any other explanatory text that you care to add. Include citations of literature if needed. Size any figures or images appropriately and use figure legends. After it all looks **sharp and professional**, export the document as a PDF. Then **upload** the PDF to moodle.
# 
# #### “Boss Quality" Documents
# In this course you are not only **exploring** advanced topics in chemistry and **mastering** your chemical instincts, you are preparing to depart from the cocoon and spread your wings in the wide world. It is time to pay attention to details that are more important in the real world than they are here. One of these is the **impression** that your work gives to those who receive it. It is not enough to be correct, you need to **effectively communicate** with others. Whether you are writing a document for your first boss or for your early investors, you will need to be **clear and easily understood**. The quality of your writing and the appearance of your work are going to matter. Presenting sloppy work shows a lack of respect for the people who are receiving it.
# 
# What kind of report would you hand to your boss? She will forgive your mistakes, but sloppy work will forever **define you** in the eyes of others. **First impressions matter** in every aspect of life. Don’t let the first impression of your work be a poor one. Those course does not require fancy, it only required "**boss quality**". What would you hand if if you had a job that you wantedv to keep?
# 
# ----
# ## 1.4 Lesson Schedule
# 
# ### Wednesday
# In our first meeting you will be asked to **propose a mechanism** for the hydrolysis of t-butyl bromide in acidic water, for the elimination reaction of t-butyl bromide in basic water, and for the hydrolysis of methyl acetate in both acidic and basic water. Your challenge will be to not only propose the **correct** mechanism, but to propose **every possible** mechanism. Then **evaluate** each mechanism and **explain** why you think each may be unlikely or likely to contribute to the observed rate of the reaction. You will leave the meeting with a handout of reactions to review for Friday.
# 
# #### Reading
# There is no reading to do in advance of starting the course however you will want to very quickly **review appendix 5 of the textbook** and try the problems you see there.
# 
# > **Read** appendix 5 of textbook (pages 1061 to 1074)<br>
# > **Read** appendix 6 (pages 1075 to 1077)
# 
# #### Suggested Problems
# During our first meeting we will attempt a few selections the following **problems** in from appendix 5. You should attempt **all** of them on your own after the class. I have copied the appendix 5 questions from the textbook and made them available on the Moodle site. Please acquire a copy of the textbook soon as I won’t be able to do this again. Respect copyright - someday you may be an author.
# 
# > **Problems**: Appendix 5 - 1, 2, 3 & 4
# 
# ##### A Note on Suggested Problems
# I am often asked **what to expect** on the tests. I can’t tell you what the questions will be, but I can say there will be **few surprises** if you do the suggested problems from the textbook and the assignments.
# 
# 
# ### Friday
# In our second meeting there will be a **short quiz** featuring a few of the reactions that you were given to review. We will **discuss** the problems suggested previously from appendix 5. be prepared to contribute. We will try to define what is meant by the words "physical organic chemsitry" and I will also introduce my vision of wrapping the activities of this course around computer tools. Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 2 to see what you should prepare for Monday. 
# 
# #### Reading
# 
# For this second meeting in the course I would like you to **come prepared** to discuss the idea of "what is physical organic chemistry?" In preparation please complete the following reading.
# >  **Read** the preface of your textbook (pages xxiii to xxiv) <br>
# >  **Read** "Physical-Organic Chemistry: A Swiss Army Knife." G.M. Whitesides, *Isr. J. Chem.*, **2016**, *56*, 66-82. https://doi-org.proxy.library.upei.ca/10.1002/ijch.201500061
# 
# ##### A Note on Links to Journals
# I will only ask you to read journal articles to which UPEI has **subscription access**. However, you may find these lins only work on campus. So you will want to **plan ahead** and download any journal articles while you are on campus. Many journals are "open access" but many are not.
# 
# ----
