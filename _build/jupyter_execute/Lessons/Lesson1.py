# # Lesson 1: Remembering The Past
# Life is about **making** things and **breaking** things, mostly chemical bonds. All of the reactions of the famous **glycolysis** pathway can be understood using organic chemistry. A deeper understanding of **physical organic chemistry** will enable you to interpret how **enzymes** provide the catalysis that enable the pathway to operate at the speed needed to be meaniful in providing **energy** for cells. Let us embark on our journey to greater understanding of all chemical reactions that make and break bonds by **reviewing** a small slice of our **previous experience**.
# 
# Our first two meetings will focus on reviewing organic chemistry.  
# 
# ## Wednesday
# In our first meeting you will be asked to **propose a mechanism** for the hydrolysis of t-butyl bromide in acidic water, for the elimination reaction of t-butyl bromide in basic water and for the hydrolysis of methyl in both acidic and basic water. Your challenge will be to not only propose the **correct** mechanism, but to propose **every possible** mechanism. Then **evaluate** each mechanism and **explain** why you think each may be unlikely or likely to contribute to the observed rate of the reaction.  
# 
# You will leave the meeting with a handout of reactions to review for Friday.
# 
# ## Friday
# In our second meeting there will be a **short quiz** featuring a few of the reactions that you were given to review. Then we will discuss the **grading scheme** for the course and I'll take any comments under advisement. I will also introduce my vision of wrapping the activities of this course around computer tools. Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 2 to see what you should prepare for Monday.
