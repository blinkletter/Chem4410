# Essential Tools

Before you read any farther, you need to know about the **tools** that are **needed** to succeed in this course. You will need access to the **textbook**, a **computer** with the software listed below and the **time** to learn on your own and complete assignments.

## Your Textbook

This document that you are reading **is not** the textbook. The textbook for this course is&hellip;

"[Modern Physical Organic Chemistry](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/modern-physical-organic-chemistry/)" by Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. University Science Books.

**This book is tour de force**. I encourage you to buy the texbook and **keep it** for life. It covers the basics of physical organic chemistry and then has chapters that **can be applied in just about any field of chemistry**. Supramolecular chemistry? Check. Conductive polymers? Check. Theoretical chemistry? Check. The textbook is available in the book store and has an ebook option available from the publisher. **All chapters and problem assignments will refer to this book**.

The textbook for this course was **written** by two emminent physical organic chemists and then **peer reviewed** and corrected by dozens more. Look around you. How many students are in this class? I guarantee you that **no one is making money** from this book. It is a **gift** from old physical organic chemists to the next generation. If we do not support efforts like this then we may never see a second edition. These guys are far too old for a patreon account. Please **do not pirate** textbooks. I know it is easy to do, but someday you may be writing a textbook of your own. Start building your karma now.


## Your Computer

Welcome to the modern world. For the past 20 years, students have **needed computers to succeed** in university. We haven't completely moved on to phones yet, so you will need access to a computer with the tools listed below. These tools will be available on many campus computers. I have selected only free software options that you can install on your own computer if you wish. **We will not be  programming**, we will be learning how to use programs. Any coding will be set up for you in advance and I likely stole it all from somewhere else on the web. I am not a coder, I am a **user**, and [users are the true heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron).

### Software Requirements

Below is a **list** of **software** that will be **available** on many campus computers and can be installed on your own computer. They are all free.

1. Interactive *Python* with the ***Jupyter* notebook** environment
    * This can be acquired via the [*Anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/) package, available for all operating systems. We will be using *Python* for our data anaysis and plotting. You will see that it is a powerful tool that you will be using for the forseeable future in your scientific career. The *Anaconda* system also includes "*R*" and other tools, but we will keep it simple and stick with *Python*. 
2. ***GAMESS*** computation chemistry application
    - We can calculate the structure and energies of small molecules on your own computer. Using this we can estimate the effects of structure changes on bonds in a molecule. We will also be able to visualize molecular orbitals. [*GAMESS*](https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/) is a minor nightmare to get going and is dependant on a command line skill set. We will all struggle together.   
3.  ***MacMolPlt***
    - [*MacMolPlt*](https://brettbode.github.io/wxmacmolplt/) is a graphical interface for building and visualizing input and output files for *GAMESS*.
4. ***Avogadro***
    - [*Avogadro*](https://avogadro.cc/) is a free chemical visualization program. It can read and write files that interface with *GAMESS* and perform simple structural optimizations. 
5. A **chemical drawing** program
    - There are many options. I recommend the [*Marvin*](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin) package from ChemAxon. It will run on any operating system.   
6. The usual stuff
    - You will need a **word processor**, **spreadsheet** and **presentation program**. A free option is the [*LibreOffice*](https://www.libreoffice.org/) package and [*Office 365*](https://www.upei.ca/learning2020/technology-basics/useful-applications) is available to all students via the university. I recommend the commercial offering in this case, since it is already paid for.

## Your Time

This course will require your time. Only you can explore the concepts of the lessons by **investing your time**. You will need **time to read** the textbook and consider the suggested problems; **time to struggle** with using the software tools as we explore data analysis and computational chemistry; **time to write** reports and prepare presentations; and **time to relax**.[^time]

[^time]: You can get your money back, you cannot get your time back.
