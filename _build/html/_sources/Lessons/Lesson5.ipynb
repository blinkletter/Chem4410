    "# Lesson 5: Acids and Bases\n",
    "Acids and bases are **core concepts** in chemistry. And it is about much more than mere $pH$. What is the acidity of 1% sulphuric acid mixture in water? How would you calculate or **measure** it? Now, what is the acidity of a 99% mixture? Does $pH$ have any meaning here? We need a way to measure the acidity of **very strong acid mixtures** so that we can use them in **experiments**. You are now ready at last to learn the truth.\n",

    "## 5.1 Lesson Plan\n",
    "The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "- I didn't truly understand **acid-base equilibria** until I started graduate school. I hope to save you a year and get the concept across in this course.\n",
    "- We will explore how to **calculate** the fraction of protonated/deprotonated species in a solution of a given acidity. We will make it super easy with a **Jupyter notebook and Python**.\n",
    "- What does $pK_a$ mean and how is it useful? Even when the value seems ridiculous? (Ch.5.1)\n",
    "- What is ”acidity”? What is $pH$? I mean, **what is it really**? What if I told you that $pH$ is not really $−\\log[H^+]$. Can you handle the truth? (Ch. 5.1)\n",
    "- Introducing the **Hammett acidity function**, $H_0$. (Ch. 5.2)\n",
    "- Predicting **relative acid strengths** by comparing molecular structure (Ch. 5.4)\n",
    "- **Solvent effects** on acid/base equilibrium (Ch. 5.3) \n",

    "## 5.2 Learning Goals\n",
    "After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand $pH$ as an **acidity function**.\n",
    "- Understand **how** the Hammett acidity function **is determined** for various acid mixtures.\n",
    "- Determine the **extent of protonation** of a reactant in various $pH$ or $H_0$ values.\n",
    "- **Calculate** the $pK_a$ of a reactant from equilibrium data.\n",
    "- Understand the **effect of resonance, induction, steric strain and electrostatic effects** on the $K_a$ value of an acidic functional group.\n",
    "- Be able to **predict** which of two related acids is stronger and explain why.\n",
    "- Understand the role of **solvent** in determining the $K_a$ value of an acidic functional group.\n",

    "## 5.3 Assignment \\#5\n",
    "\n",
    "The following assignment is to be submitted via moodle before the Friday meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a **plot** of one set of $pK_a$ values against a set of related $pK_a$ values. PErhaps plot $pK_a$ values in water vs. $pK_a$ values in DMSO. Or plot $pK_a$ values in water vs. gas phase. Or plot $pK_a$ values of **substituted benzoic acids** agains $pK_a$ values of substituted phenols or substituted pyridines or substituted something else. An example will be presented in class so you will know exactly what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Report\n",
    "> We are now exploring **data analysis** and so your report should be an **executable Jupyter notebook** that documents your activity while providing the code and results of the code. Feel free to start with the example notebook presented during the lesson week and alter it to suit you. <br>\n",
    "> **Write** your notebook in a neat and well organized form. Include comments on your observations and attempt to **explain** them. Is the result obvious to you, or is it a surprise? **Submit a .zip file** that contains the notebook and the data file that you created. Data analysis projects are presented with code and raw data in modern journals, often as Jupyter notebooks. Keeping the code and data together **helps others** to follow your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.\n",

    "-----\n",
    "## 5.4 Lesson Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monday \n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the **math** of acid/base equilibria using Jupyter notebooks as our calculator. We will introduce the idea of the **acidity function**. $pH$ is just one of many options for expressing acid strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Read** Chapter 5.1 \\& 5.2  <br>\n",
    "> **Read and Use** the Jupyter notebooks for acid equilibria described below and available on the moodle page\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Attempt** the following problems at the end of Ch. 5: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12 \\& 20  <br>\n",
    "> **Explore** the Jupyter notebooks and change them to suit you\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wednesday\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider how structure affects acidity. The most obvious example is substituted benzoic acids. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Read** Chapter 5.3 \\& 5.4  <br>\n",
    "> **Read and Use** the Jupyter notebooks for plotting $pK_a$ values agains each other described below and available on the moodle page\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Friday\n",
    "\n",
    "In our third meeting for this lesson there will be a **short quiz** featuring problems adapted from the suggested textbook problems above. We will then discuss how the plots in our assignment revealed **correlation** (or not) between series of acid strengths. Could this **correlation** be used as a score for how structure affects electron density in a molecule?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 3 to see what you should prepare for Monday. \n",
