    "# Lesson 2: Molecular Structure\n",
    "What holds the world together? **Chemical bonds**. What are they? They are not lines or dots, they are an arrangement of electrons and nuclei that are lower in energy than other options. Let us explore what bonds really are by considering the **electronic structure** of a molecule.\n",

    "## 2.1 Lesson Plan\n",
    "The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas$\\ldots$\n",
    "- **Electronic structure**in molecules: Lewis structure and VSEPR theory \n",
    "- **Hybrid orbitals**, $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ bonds and resonance\n",
    "- Constructing **Molecular orbitals** (the textbook presents a fairly complicated method for building accurate molecular orbitals using hybrid orbitals. I will be presenting a simpler method that produces less accurate but equally useful molecular orbitals for interpreting reactivity). \n",
    "- We will **construct molecular orbitals** for alkenes, ketones and enolates and discuss how the shape and size of the orbitals directs reactivity. **See the Molecular Orbital Tutorial** described in the resources section below and available on the Moodle site.\n",
    "- We will then explore how molecular orbital theory revelas details that Lewis structure cannot and explore this idea using **Hückel Molecular orbital theory (HMOT)**.\n",
    "    - Interpreting the **reactivity** of an alkene and a carbonyl group to electrophiles and nucleophiles\n",
    "    - Using Huckel molecular orbital theory (HMOT) to investigate the properties of **conjugated and aromatic** MO systems.\n",
    "        - The example of the allyl cation and anion\n",
    "        - The example of the benzyl cation and phenolate anion\n",
    "        - The example of naphthalene and azulene\n",
    "- The computational; power of **Python** will be introduced along with the convenience of **Jupyter** Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "## 2.2 Learning Goals\n",
    "After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to$\\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how **hydrid orbitals** are constructed from atomic orbitals according to bond angles.\n",
    "- Calculate the **hydridization** of a carbon atom from bond angles and use this information to **interpret electronic structure**.\n",
    "- Construct an approximate **molecular orbital diagram** from a basis set of atomic orbitals and be able to **predict reactivity** and relative stability using the diagram.\n",
    "- Use the results of a **HMOT calculations** to interpret reactivity in a conjugated or aromatic system.\n",
    "- Estimate the effects of **polar atoms** in that conjugated system on the MO arrangement.\n",
    "- Be able to use interactive **Python** to solve computational problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Consider** the two arrow-pushing in {numref}`directive-fig` below for the formation of a carbocation from an alkene and from a ketone. **Do you agree** with the arrow pushing? Think about how the arrow-pushing fits with what you know about the **frontier molecular orbitals** involved.\n",

    "### The Report\n",
    "> **Create** a document in which you present theapproximate  **molecular orbital diagram** for each reactant and **identify** the **frontier molecular orbitals**. Using this information either **confirm or criticize the arrow pushing**. Be brief in your explanation but be clear. Provide a corrected reactionreaction scheme if needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Monday \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with a discussion of Lewis structure and how it is surprisingly effective in approximating the information available from more sophisticated local molecular orbital (LMO) approaches (LMO). We will then review molecular orbital theory and construct a molecular orbital diagram using the LMO method. How does arrow pushing and Lewis structures relate to the molecular orbital diagrams of reactants and products?\n",

    "We will **easily and quickly calculate** the molecular orbitals for a handful of molecules. Furan, pyrole and the Cp anion? **Naphthalene and azulene** are aromatic compounds with the same number of carbons and electrons, yet they have very different properties. Can SHMOT reveal why? You will see how computers can be your friends. \n",
