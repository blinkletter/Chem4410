# Lesson 8: Tools, Part 2
INTRO

## 8.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- Substituent can change the energy in transition states and equilibria (Ch. 8.2)
    - Inductive effects, resonance effects, rield effects & rteric effects
- A standard system to investigate substituent effects – the substituted phenyl group (Ch. 8.3)
    - Measuring substituent effects
    - Hammett parameters
    - Hammett plots
- Application of Hammett plots
- The Brown-Okamoto parameters
- The Yukawa-Tsuno two parameter plot
- Observing changes in transition state structure, rate-determining step or changes in mechanism by using Hammett plots (curved plots) (Ch. 8.3)
- Isolating different substituent effects: Separating sterics from electron-
ics
    – The Taft-Ingold parameters and plot (Ch. 8.4)
- Measuring solvent effects
    – The Grunwald-Winstein plot (Ch. 8.4)
- What is a linear free energy relationship (LFER)? (Ch. 8.6)


## 8.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

• Interpret data from LFER experiments and draw conclusions about the structure of transition states or high energy intermediates.
• Describe what the parameters of various LFER plots measure and how the reference reaction was set up.
• Evaluate the suitability of a give LFER approach for a given investigation.
• Predict the likely effects if a substituent on a reaction centre (inductive, resonance, field and steric effects).
• Use Hammett plots to make conclusions about the structure of a transition state or high energy intermediate in a reaction.
• Correctly use the Brown-Okamoto parameters (&sigma;<sup>+</sup>, &sigma;<sup>-</sup>) when required.
- Understand the usefulness of parameters that score phytsical properties, such a size of a substituent, in QSAR.

### Friday

In our third meeting for this lesson there will be a **short quiz** featuring problems adapted from the suggested textbook problems above. After the presentations, we will then discuss .... Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 6 to see what you should prepare for Monday. 

#### Presentations

> Two of you will have been selected on Monday to present the results of the assignment. You will want to ask your presentation partner what they are doing so you can be sure that you are both making different correlations.
