# Lesson 8: Tools, Part 2

You may examine you mechanism and observe that you are proposing a **transition state** that has significantly **more charge** at the reaction center than in the reactants. Modifying your reactants with **subtituents** that stabilize or destabilize that charge should **change the rate** of reaction. Can we make this into a useful quantitative method?

We must develop a standard **scoring system** for hoe electron-donating or withdrawing the substituent is. Then we can use that standard score to measure the effect of these changes on the reaction. If the **substituent effect** is large then there is a large change in charge. The **magnitude and direction** of the effect can tell us much about the transition state.

This method has grown into the general stratefy of **linear free energfy relationships**. One system is used to create a score the the substituent effect and then those scores are used to evaluate the magnitude and direction of the effect in another system. We can create scores for **inductive** and **resonance** electronic effects, electrical **field** effects, **size**, solvent **polarity**, **nucleophilicity** and much more. 

Get out your **data tables** and slide rulers. I will go easy on you - we will be using the internet and interactive *Python* notebooks.

## 8.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- **Substituents** can change the energy in transition states and equilibria (Ch. 8.2)
    - Inductive effects, resonance effects, field effects & steric effects
- The **Hammett equation**: a standard system to investigate substituent effects 
    – The substituted phenyl group (Ch. 8.3)
    - Measuring **substituent effects**
    - Hammett parameters (&sigma;)
    - Hammett plots
- Application of **Hammett plots**
    - The Brown-Okamoto parameters (&sigma;<sup>+</sup>, &sigma;<sup>-</sup>)
    - The Yukawa-Tsuno two parameter plot
    - Observing **changes** in transition state **structure**, rate-determining step or changes in mechanism by using Hammett plots (curved plots) (Ch. 8.3)
- **Separating** sterics from electronics
    – The Taft-Ingold parameters and plot (Ch. 8.4)
- Measuring **solvent effects**
    – The Grunwald-Winstein plot (Ch. 8.4)
- What is a linear free energy relationship (((LFER)))? (Ch. 8.6)

## 8.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

- **Interpret** data from LFER **experiments** and draw conclusions about the **structure** of transition states or high energy intermediates.
- **Describe** what the parameters of various LFER plots measure and how the **reference** reaction was set up.
- Evaluate the **suitability** of a give LFER approach for a given investigation.
- **Predict** the likely **effects** if a substituent on a **reaction** centre (inductive, resonance, field and steric effects).
- Use **Hammett plots** to make conclusions about the structure of a **transition state** or high energy intermediate in a reaction.
- Correctly use the Brown-Okamoto parameters (&sigma;<sup>+</sup>, &sigma;<sup>-</sup>) when required.
- Understand the **usefulness** of parameters that score phytsical properties, such as the **size** of a substituent, in QSAR.

## 8.3 Assignment \#5

The following assignment is to be submitted via moodle before the Friday meeting.

### The Instructions
This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following&hellip;

> Take a **data set** fom the moodle site for the reactions listed below. **Draw** out a mechamism for the reaction. **Plot** the Hammett plot using the corresponding data sets. **Write** a report in which you present your mechanism, the Hammett plot and a discussion on how the plot supports your **hypothesis**. Did you have to adjust your hypothesis after making the plot? Did it **prove** that you we right all along? If the Hammett plot forced you to change your hypothesis, please indicate your journey from your hypothesis to the revised model.

Try all of the following reactions and plot all of the following data sets. 

|  Card    | Reaction | Data Set |
| :----     | :-----   | :------  |
| 1 or 7     | Hydrolysis of benzyl chorides | BzCl_1.csv |
|  2 or 8    | Hydrolysis of chlorodiphenylmethanes | ClDPhM.csv |
|  3 or 9    | Basic Elimination of 1-Phenyl-1-ethanols |   1P1E_B.csv    |
|  4 or 10    | Basic Elimination of 2-Phenyl-1-ethanols |   2P1E_B.csv    |
|   5 or Jack   | Acidic Elimination of 1-Phenyl-1-ethanols |   2P1E_A.csv    |
|   6 or Queen   | Acidic Elimination of 2-Phenyl-1-ethanols |   2P1E_A.csv    |


### The Deliverable

> You will be randomly assigned a **single example** from the data sets provided to present in a formal **report**. Include all of the elements described above. Be neat and professional. Use proper chemical **drawing tools** and plotting software. I recommend *Marvin* for the chemical structures and a *Jupyter* Notebook for the plots.

### Grading

**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.

## 8.4 Lesson Schedule

### Monday 

How can you score the **electronic effect** of a **substituent** in a system. First, find a **reference** system where the only effect is electronic. Louis Hammett used *meta* and *para*-substituted **benzoic acids** and created a series of **substituent parameters**. These evolved into the substituent parameters we use today: &sigma;<sub>m</sub>, &sigma;<sub>p</sub>, &sigma;<sup>+</sup>, \& &sigma;<sup>-</sup>.

We will explore how we can use this score for electronic effects in benzoic acids to measure the **sensitivity** of a transtion state to changes in electron density. This information will enables us to test our hypothesis for the mechanism in many cases.

#### Reading

> **Read** Chapter 8.2, 8.3 & 8.6

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems from Ch. 8: 11, 14, 15 & 18

### Wednesday

We will explore **other methods** that use the idea of LFER. We can **separate** inductive and resonance effects using the **Yukawa-Tsuno equation**, we can examine the sensitivity of the reaction to **solvent polarity**, we can explore the sensitivity of the reaction to **changes in nucleophile** and leaving group nad we can score the sensitivity of the reaction to the **acid or base** involved. There are many other LFER schemes but we will stick to this short list.

#### Reading

> **Read** Chapter 8.4, 8.5 & 8.7

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems from Ch. 8: 9, 10, 12, 16 & 24

### Friday

In our third meeting for this lesson there will be a **short quiz** featuring problems adapted from the suggested textbook problems above. After the presentations, we will then discuss the assigment and selected problems. Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 9 to see what you should prepare for Monday. 

#### Presentations

> Two of you will have been selected on Monday to present your results from the assignment.
