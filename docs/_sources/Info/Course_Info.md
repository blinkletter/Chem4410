# Course Information

## Description

This course examines the qualitative and quantitative **relationships** between the **rates and mechanisms** of organic reactions, and the **electronic and physical structures** of reactants. Among the topics considered are: theory and applications of inductive and resonance effects, **linear free energy relationships**, kinetic isotope effects, solvent effects, steric effects in substitution and elimination reactions, acids and bases and pericyclic reactions, applications of semi-empirical and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. 

Course materials and communications are available through Moodle.

## Office Hours
I will be **available** for office hours at the times listed below. you can also make an appointment. You can meet me in person or by web conference.

### Schedule
Monday to Thursday: 10:30 – 11:15


## Textbook
The textbook for this course is an **excellent book** and worth keeping. There is a chapter for almost every field of chemistry in it. I will be using…

"[Modern Physical Organic Chemistry](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/modern-physical-organic-chemistry/)" by Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. University Science Books. Text may be purchased at the bookstore.

The following books are also helpful…
- “Physical Organic Chemistry” by Neil Isaacs
- "Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry", 3rd Edition, by Lowry and Richardson 
- "Structure and Mechanism in Organic Chemistry", by Felix A. Caroll
- “Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions and Mechanisms” by Bernard Miller; especially chapters 1 & 5.
- Oxford Chemistry Primers #81: “Structure and Reactivity in Organic Chemistry” by Howard Maskill
- Oxford Chemistry Primers #45: “Mechanisms of Organic Reactions” by Howard Maskill

## Method of Delivery
The course will be organized in a weekly format. Each **Friday**, I will briefly introduce the subject for the following week and assign readings and problems. 

On the following **Monday**, I will present some more material on the subject and discuss some selected problems. I will also answer any questions that you have come up with over the weekend as you began your reading and started working on the problems. 

In the **Wednesday** class, I will be calling on individual students to present their work on the assigned problems. We will help each other with any difficulties that we encounter – so do take a look at all the problems that have been assigned so that you are ready to participate and help your peers.

On **Friday**, two of you will be selected to present their work on their assignment (you will know in advance who is presenting.) We will then have a 20-minute quiz. Then I will introduce the next week’s topic and the cycle continues…

This grading scheme is open for revision. Any ideas?.

### Class Activities 
You will be evaluated on your preparedness for lectures. Students are expected to **arrive prepared** to participate in discussion of the topic. **Readings and exercises** will be assigned in advance to assist students in preparing for each class. Feel free to help each other with **in-class questions**. The class questions are meant to stimulate **discussion** and develop your skills. Academic integrity is a new focus at UPEI due to the online nature of the courses, but **do not hesitate to work together on class problems**.  Just thank those who helped you when presenting your solution. Take note that the **assignments** (see below) are to be completed **individually**.

### Assignments
Each week will feature an **assignment** to be completed. Most of these assignments will involve writing a **short report**. Students will have at least 4 days to complete an assignment and submit the report. Late reports will not be accepted without a valid reason. Reports are to be your own **individual work**. 

### Presentation
There will two or three **presentations** by each student during this course. Your presentation is to be short but substantial (less than 10 minutes). Each presentation will feature your work on an assignment or part of an assignment. You will be **tasked** in turn with a week's notice. More details will be available when the topics are assigned.

### Class Quizzes
Most weeks will have a short **class quiz** on Friday. You will be given a list of possible quiz topics or questions (this will usually be the textbook problems assigned for Mondays and Wednesday). The quiz will be based on a selection of those. If a student cannot attend a test, they must have a valid reason and must inform the instructor in advance of the test to make alternate arrangements. 

## Academic Integrity 
As a **community of scholars**, the University of Prince Edward Island is committed to the principle of academic integrity among all its participants. Academic **dishonesty** as defined in [Academic Regulation 20](https://calendar.upei.ca/current/chapter/undergraduate-and-professional-programs-academic-regulations/) and **will not be tolerated**. Within the constraints of this regulation and [Academic Regulation 12](https://calendar.upei.ca/current/chapter/undergraduate-and-professional-programs-academic-regulations/), the University supports instructors in their efforts to deal effectively with cases as they may arise from time to time.

## Accommodation Statement
Students may request **accommodation** as a result of **barriers** experienced related to disability, or any characteristic protected under Canadian Human Rights legislation. Students who require academic accommodation for either classroom participation or the writing of tests and exams should make their request to **Accessibility Services** as soon as possible. Please visit [upei.ca/accessibility](https://upei.ca/accessibility) for more information

## Land Acknowledgement
The land on which the University of Prince Edward Island is located is **Epekwitk**, the traditional and current territory of the **Mi’kmaq People** of this region. It is one of seven traditional Mi’kmaq regions that comprise Atlantic Canada, parts of eastern Quebec, and Maine. Mi’kma’ki is the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq people, who, in 1725 first signed the **Treaties of Peace and Friendship** with the British Crown. Those treaties did not deal with the surrender of lands and resources, but instead recognized Mi’kmaq title and negotiated a path toward an ongoing relationship between nations. We acknowledge that we carry out our daily work and learning in Mi’kma’ki.
