# Lesson 8: Tools, Part 2

You may examine you mechanism and observe that you are proposing a **transition state** that has significantly **more charge** at the reaction center than in the reactants. Modifying your reactants with **subtituents** that stabilize or destabilize that charge should **change the rate** of reaction. Can we make this into a useful quantitative method?

We must develop a standard **scoring system** for hoe electron-donating or withdrawing the substituent is. Then we can use that standard score to measure the effect of these changes on the reaction. If the **substituent effect** is large then there is a large change in charge. The **magnitude and direction** of the effect can tell us much about the transition state.

This method has grown into the general stratefy of **linear free energfy relationships**. One system is used to create a score the the substituent effect and then those scores are used to evaluate the magnitude and direction of the effect in another system. We can create scores for **inductive** and **resonance** electronic effects, electrical **field** effects, **size**, solvent **polarity**, **nucleophilicity** and much more. 

Get out your **data tables** and slide rulers. I will go easy on you - we will be using the internet and interactive *Python* notebooks.

## 8.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- Substituents can change the energy in transition states and equilibria (Ch. 8.2)
    - Inductive effects, resonance effects, field effects & steric effects
- Hammett's approach: a standard system to investigate substituent effects 
    – The substituted phenyl group (Ch. 8.3)
    - Measuring substituent effects
    - Hammett parameters (&sigma;)
    - Hammett plots
- Application of Hammett plots
    - The Brown-Okamoto parameters (&sigma;<sup>+</sup>, &sigma;<sup>-</sup>)
    - The Yukawa-Tsuno two parameter plot
    - Observing changes in transition state structure, rate-determining step or changes in mechanism by using Hammett plots (curved plots) (Ch. 8.3)
- Isolating different substituent effects: Separating sterics from electronics
    – The Taft-Ingold parameters and plot (Ch. 8.4)
- Measuring solvent effects
    – The Grunwald-Winstein plot (Ch. 8.4)
- What is a linear free energy relationship (LFER)? (Ch. 8.6)

## 8.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

- Interpret data from LFER experiments and draw conclusions about the structure of transition states or high energy intermediates.
- Describe what the parameters of various LFER plots measure and how the reference reaction was set up.
- Evaluate the suitability of a give LFER approach for a given investigation.
- Predict the likely effects if a substituent on a reaction centre (inductive, resonance, field and steric effects).
- Use Hammett plots to make conclusions about the structure of a transition state or high energy intermediate in a reaction.
- Correctly use the Brown-Okamoto parameters (&sigma;<sup>+</sup>, &sigma;<sup>-</sup>) when required.
- Understand the usefulness of parameters that score phytsical properties, such a size of a substituent, in QSAR.

### Grading
**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.

## 8.4 Lesson Schedule

### Monday 

How can you score the **electronic effect** of a **substituent** in a system. First, find a **reference** system where the only effect is electronic. Louis Hammett used *meta* and *para*-substituted **benzoic acids** and created a series of **substituent parameters**. These evolved into the substituent parameters we use today: &sigma;<sub>m</sub>, &sigma;<sub>p</sub>, &sigma;<sup>+</sup>, \& &sigma;<sup>-</sup>.

We will explore how we can use this score for electronic effects in benzoic acids to measure the **sensitivity** of a transtion state to changes in electron density. This information will enables us to test our hypothesis for the mechanism in many cases.

#### Reading

> **Read** Chapter 8.2, 8.3 & 8.6

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems from Ch. 8: 11, 14, 15 & 18

### Wednesday

We will explore **other methods** that use the idea of LFER. We can **separate** inductive and resonance effects using the **Yukawa-Tsuno equation**, we can examine the sensitivity of the reaction to **solvent polarity**, we can explore the sensitivity of the reaction to **changes in nucleophile** and leaving group nad we can score the sensitivity of the reaction to the **acid or base** involved. There are many other LFER schemes but we will stick to this short list.

#### Reading

> **Read** Chapter 8.4, 8.5 & 8.7

#### Suggested Problems

> **Attempt** the following problems from Ch. 8: 9, 10, 12, 16 & 24

### Friday

In our third meeting for this lesson there will be a **short quiz** featuring problems adapted from the suggested textbook problems above. After the presentations, we will then discuss the assigment and selected problems. Finally the topics for the **next lesson** will be introduced. **Look ahead** to Lesson 9 to see what you should prepare for Monday. 

#### Presentations

> Two of you will have been selected on Monday to present the results of the assignment.
