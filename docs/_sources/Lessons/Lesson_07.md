# Lesson 7: Tools, Part 1

So you've proposed a **mechanism** - now what? Now you must perform an **experiment** to back up your **hypothesis**. There are many ways we could do this by using the **toolbox** of physical organic chemistry.

We can use straight forward methods such as **product analysis**. Do the products observed result from your mechanism? Are there any products that cannot be accounted for by your mechanism? **Stereochemistry** can be very important in product analysis. If you hypothesize a reactive intermediate, can you react it with another molecule to prove that it exists. If you can **trap** it you can prove it.

We can get clever. We can change a hydrogen atom for its **isotope**, deuterium.  This will not change the electronic structure and will not change the structure of the transition state. But it will change **vibrational energies** and if that bond is involved with any vibrations in the transition state it may become evident in the reaction kinetics. **Isotope effects** are an important tool in physical organic chemistry.

## 7.1 Lesson Plan
The plan below is not necessarily what will happen in class – it is merely what I **hope** will happen in class. We will explore the following subjects and ideas&hellip;

- Isotope effects (Ch. 8.1) 
- Product analysis (structure of products and reactants) Ch. 8.8.2 
- Stereochemical analysis of products Ch. 8.8.6
- Trapping an intermediate Ch. 8.8.3, 8.8.8
- Crossover experiments Ch. 8.8.5
- Isotope scrambling Ch. 8.8.6
- Radical clocks Ch. 8.8.8
- Flash photolysis spectroscopy 8.8.10, 7.6.2 
- Quantum Tunnelling Ch. 8.1.5

## 7.2 Learning Goals
After reading the suggested textbook section and practicing the problems you should be able to&hellip;

- Calculate the maximum possible isotope effect for isotopic substitution at a given bond.
- Predict if a reaction should show a primary or secondary isotope effect and if that effect is regular or inverse.
- Use reaction kinetic data from isotopic substitution experiments to confirm or refute the hypothesis derived above.
- Use isotope effects to investigate reaction mechanism.
- Design an experiment to investigate a mechanism hypothesis using isotopic substitution, product analysis, chemical kinetics or other relevant methods.

## 7.3 Assignment \#7

The following assignment is to be submitted via moodle before the Friday meeting.

### The Instructions
This section describes the **activity** that you are to perform for the assignment. Do the following&hellip;

> **Draw** a More O’Farrell–Jencks plot for each of the following cases. Place structures of reactants and intermediates **appropriately** at the corners of the plot. Draw the typical **path** for the reaction in each case and locate the **transition states** and any intermediates on the plots. Then draw the vectors for **movement** along the coordinate and perpendicular to the coordinate as the reactants are changed as described in each case. use this diagram to discuss the **changes** in transition state structure.

1. **Case #1**: A *S<sub>N</sub>2* reaction for the reaction of ethylamine with benzylchloride to produce the protonated secondary amine product. Then consider the change in the reaction coordinate and transition state when we use a better leaving group (e.g. bromide)
2. **Case #2**: A *S<sub>N</sub>2* reaction for the reaction of ethylamine with benzylchloride to produce the protonated secondary amine product. Then consider the change in the reaction coordinate and transition state when we use a stronger nucleophile (e.g. hydrazine)
3. **Case #3**: An *E2* reaction for the reaction of ethylamine with (2-Chloroethyl)benzene to produce styrene. Then consider the change in the reaction coordinate and transition state when we use a stronger base (e.g. DBU)
4. **Case #4**: An *E2* reaction for the reaction of ethylamine with (2-Chloroethyl)benzene to produce styrene. Then consider the change in the reaction coordinate and transition state when we use a better leaving group (e.g. bromide)
5. **Case #5**: An *E2* reaction for the reaction of ethylamine with (2-Chloroethyl)benzene to produce styrene. Then consider the change in the reaction coordinate and transition state when we use a more electron-deficient reactant (e.g. p-(2-Chloroethyl)nitrobenzene)


### The Deliverable
> After you have complete the assignment described above you will submit a **report** based on a **single case** according to the **table** below. The number is the value of the **card** drawn in class.

In your report you will present your assigned **More-O’Farrell–Jencks plot** as described above. You may submit a report containing a very neat hand-drawn version of your plot or use more professional **tools**. Since all documents that you produce represent you more effectively than that message-T-shirt you have been considering, I suggest upping your game at this point.

If you make a hand-drawn plot please adjust contrast and brightness so that the lines are dark and the paper is white. 

| Card      |  Assignment  |
| :---      | :---         |
| 1 or 6    |  Case #1     |
| 2 or 7    |  Case #2     |
| 3 or 8    |  Case #3     |
| 4 or 9    |  Case #4     |
| 5 or 10   |  Case #5     |

### Grading

**Half** of the grade will be for your **answer** and **half** will evaluate how neat, **clear and professional** your are in communicating your answer. Feel free to use a chemical drawing program. Take pride in your work.
