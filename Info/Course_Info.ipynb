    "# Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course examines the qualitative and quantitative **relationships** between the **rates and mechanisms** of organic reactions, and the **electronic and physical structures** of reactants. Among the topics considered are: theory and applications of inductive and resonance effects, **linear free energy relationships**, kinetic isotope effects, solvent effects, steric effects in substitution and elimination reactions, acids and bases and pericyclic reactions, applications of semi-empirical and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. **Prerequisite**: Chemistry 2420, 3420\n",

    "\n",
    "### Preparation \n",
    "Come **prepared** with your question and be able to describe the problem and your attempts to solve it. Do not come to my office and expect to go through the notes of the entire class or just be handed an answer. You should read the book, talk with classmates and make a real attempt to solve the problem before coming to me. It is my goal to develop the **independent** learning skills of my students. You can solve any problem if you apply the necessary resources. Be confident, plunge ahead and come to me if you get stuck.\n",

    "## Textbook\n",
    "The textbook for this course is an **excellent book** and worth keeping. There is a chapter for almost every field of chemistry in it. I will be using…\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[Modern Physical Organic Chemistry](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/modern-physical-organic-chemistry/)\" by Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. University Science Books. Text may be purchased at the bookstore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following books are also helpful…\n",
    "- “Physical Organic Chemistry” by Neil Isaacs\n",
    "- \"Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry\", 3rd Edition, by Lowry and Richardson \n",
    "- \"Structure and Mechanism in Organic Chemistry\", by Felix A. Caroll\n",
    "- “Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions and Mechanisms” by Bernard Miller; especially chapters 1 & 5.\n",
    "- Oxford Chemistry Primers #81: “Structure and Reactivity in Organic Chemistry” by Howard Maskill\n",
    "- Oxford Chemistry Primers #45: “Mechanisms of Organic Reactions” by Howard Maskill\n",

    "## Method of Delivery\n",
    "The course will be organized in a weekly format. Each **Friday**, I will briefly introduce the subject for the following week and assign readings and problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the following **Monday**, I will present some more material on the subject and discuss some selected problems. I will also answer any questions that you have come up with over the weekend as you began your reading. Students will have been assigned individual problems and assignments on Friday or on this Monday. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Wednesday** class, I will be calling on individual students to present their work on the assigned problems. We will help each other with any difficulties that we encounter – so do take a look at problems that have been assigned to others so that you are ready to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "On **Friday**, two of you will be selected to present their work on their assignment (you will know who is presenting by Monday at the latest.) We will then have a 20-minute quiz. Then I will introduce the next week’s topic and the cycle continues…\n",

    "### Class Activities \n",
    "You will be evaluated on your preparedness for lectures. Students are expected to **arrive prepared** to participate in discussion of the topic. **Readings and exercises** will be assigned in advance to assist students in preparing for each class. Feel free to help each other with **in-class questions**. The class questions are meant to stimulate **discussion** and develop your skills. Academic integrity is a new focus at UPEI due to the online nature of the courses, but do not hesitate to work together on class problems.  Just thank those who helped you when presenting your solution. Take note that the **assignments** (see below) are to be completed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments\n",
    "Each week will feature an **assignment** to be completed. Most of these assignments will involve writing a **short report**. Students will have at least 4 days to complete an assignment and submit the report. Late reports will not be accepted without a valid reason. Reports are to be your own **individual work**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "There will a **major presentation** during the course by each student. Your presentation is to be short but substantial (10 to 15 minutes). Each presentation must be accompanied by a handout for your fellow students. More details will be available when the topics are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Quizzes\n",
    "Most weeks will have a short **class quiz** on Friday. You will be given a list of possible quiz topics or questions each Monday. The quiz will use a selection of those. If a student cannot attend a test, they must have a valid reason and must inform the instructor in advance of the test to make alternate arrangements. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Integrity \n",
    "As a **community of scholars**, the University of Prince Edward Island is committed to the principle of academic integrity among all its participants. Academic **dishonesty** as defined in this [Regulation 20](https://calendar.upei.ca/current/chapter/undergraduate-and-professional-programs-academic-regulations/) and **will not be tolerated** within the constraints of this Regulation and Academic [Regulation 12](https://calendar.upei.ca/current/chapter/undergraduate-and-professional-programs-academic-regulations/), the University supports instructors in their efforts to deal effectively with cases as they may arise from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accommodation Statement\n",
    "Students may request **accommodation** as a result of **barriers** experienced related to disability, or any characteristic protected under Canadian Human Rights legislation. Students who require academic accommodation for either classroom participation or the writing of tests and exams should make their request to **Accessibility Services** as soon as possible. Please visit [upei.ca/accessibility](https://upei.ca/accessibility) for more information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Land Acknowledgement\n",
    "The land on which the University of Prince Edward Island is located is **Epekwitk**, the traditional and current territory of the **Mi’kmaq People** of this region. Epekwitk, which is the Mi’kmaq name for the area now known as Prince Edward Island, is one of seven traditional Mi’kmaq regions i\n",
    "n Mi’kma’ki (the ancestral lands that comprise Atlantic Canada, and parts of eastern Quebec and Maine). Mi’kma’ki is the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq people, who, in 1725 first signed the **Treaties of Peace and Friendship** with the British Crown. Those treaties did not deal with the surrender of lands and resources, but instead recognized Mi’kmaq title and negotiated a path toward an ongoing relationship between nations. We acknowledge we carry out our daily work in Mi’kma’ki."
