    "Come **prepared** with your question and be able to describe the problem and your attempts to solve it. Do not come to my office and expect to go through the notes of the entire class or just be handed an answer. You should read the book, talk with classmates and make a real attempt to solve the problem before coming to me. It is my goal to develop the **independent** learning skills of my students. You can solve any problem if you apply the necessary resources. Be confident, plunge ahead and come to me if you get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Textbook\n",
    "The textbook for this course is an **excellent book** and worth keeping. There is a chapter for almost every field of chemistry in it. I will be using…\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[Modern Physical Organic Chemistry](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/modern-physical-organic-chemistry/)\" by Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. University Science Books. Text may be purchased at the bookstore.\n",

    "The course will be organized in a weekly format. Each **Friday**, I will briefly introduce the subject for the following week and assign readings and problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the following **Monday**, I will present some more material on the subject and discuss some selected problems. I will also answer any questions that you have come up with over the weekend as you began your reading. Students will have been assigned individual problems and assignments on Friday or on this Monday. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Wednesday** class, I will be calling on individual students to present their work on the assigned problems. We will help each other with any difficulties that we encounter – so do take a look at problems that have been assigned to others so that you are ready to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "On **Friday**, two of you will be selected to present their work on their assignment (you will know who is presenting by Monday at the latest.) We will then have a 20-minute quiz. Then I will introduce the next week’s topic and the cycle continues…\n",

    "\n",
    "This grading scheme is open for revision. Any ideas?.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Activities \n",
    "You will be evaluated on your preparedness for lectures. Students are expected to **arrive prepared** to participate in discussion of the topic. **Readings and exercises** will be assigned in advance to assist students in preparing for each class. Feel free to help each other with **in-class questions**. The class questions are meant to stimulate **discussion** and develop your skills. Academic integrity is a new focus at UPEI due to the online nature of the courses, but do not hesitate to work together on class problems.  Just thank those who helped you when presenting your solution. Take note that the **assignments** (see below) are to be completed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments\n",
    "Each week will feature an **assignment** to be completed. Most of these assignments will involve writing a **short report**. Students will have at least 4 days to complete an assignment and submit the report. Late reports will not be accepted without a valid reason. Reports are to be your own **individual work**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "There will a **major presentation** during the course by each student. Your presentation is to be short but substantial (10 to 15 minutes). Each presentation must be accompanied by a handout for your fellow students. More details will be available when the topics are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Quizzes\n",
    "Most weeks will have a short **class quiz** on Friday. You will be given a list of possible quiz topics or questions each Monday. The quiz will use a selection of those. If a student cannot attend a test, they must have a valid reason and must inform the instructor in advance of the test to make alternate arrangements. \n",

    "## Essential Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you read any farther you need to know about the **tools** that are **needed** to succeed in this course. At the start of medical school student buy their very own stethoscope. They need it to succeed and they **invest in their success**. The same is true for any university course. There are some things you will need and cannot do without.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[Modern Physical Organic Chemistry](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/modern-physical-organic-chemistry/)\" by Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. University Science Books.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This book is tour de force**. It covers the basics of physical organic chemistry (and that is our goal in this course) and then has chapters that feature how the what you learned here **can be applied in just about any field of chemistry**. Supramolecular chemistry? check? COnductive polymers? Check. theoretical chemistry? Check. The textbook is available in the book store and has an ebook option available from the publisher. **All chapters and problem assignments will refer to this book**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document **is not** the textbook. The textbook for this course was **written** by two emminent physical organic chemists and then **peer reviewed** and corrects by dozens more. I encourage you to buy the texbook and keep it for life. Look around you. How many students are in this class? I guarantee you that no one is making money from this book. It is a gift from old physical organic chemists to the next generation. However, if we do not support efforts like this then we may never see a second edition. These guys are far too old for a patreon account. Please **do not pirate** textbooks. I know it is easy to do but someday you may be writing a textbook of your own. Start on your karma now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the modern world. For the past 20 years students have **needed computers to succeed** in university. We haven't moved on to phones yet, so you will need access to a computer with the tools listed below. These tools will be available on many campus computers. I have selected only free software options that you can install on your own computer if you wish. **We will not be  programming**, we will be learning how to use programs. Any coding will be set up for you in advance and I likely stole it all from somewhere else on the web myself. I am not a coder, I am a **user**, and [users are gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interactive Python with the Jupyter notebook environment\n",
    "    * This can be acquired via the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package, available for all operating systems. We will be using Python for our data anaysis and plotting. You will see that it is a powerful tool that you will be using for the forseeable future in your scientific career. The Anaconda system also includes \"R\" and other tools, but we will keep it simple and stick with Python. \n",
    "2. GAMESS computation chemistry application\n",
    "    - We can calculate the structure and energies of small molecules on your own computer. Using this we can immediately see the effects of structure changes on bonds in a molecule. We will also be able to visualize molecular orbitals. [GAMESS](https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/) is a minor nightmare to get going and is dependant on a command line skill set. We will all struggle together.   \n",
    "3. A chemical drawing program\n",
    "    - There are many options. I recommend the [Marvin](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin) package from ChemAxon. It will run on any operating system.   \n",
    "4. The usual stuff\n",
    "    - You will need a word processor, spreadsheet and presentation program. A free option is the [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) package but [Office 365](https://www.upei.ca/learning2020/technology-basics/useful-applications) is available to all students via the university. I recommend the commercial offering in this case, since it is already paid for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Time\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will require your time. Only you can explore the concepts of the lessons by **investing your time**. You will need time to **read the textbook** and consider the **suggested problems**; time to struggle with using the software tools as we explore **data analysis** and computational chemistry; time to **write reports** and prepare and practice **presentations**; and time to **relax**.[^time]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^time]: Life tip: your house must be worth more than your car. Your car must be worth more than your computer. Your time must be worth more than any of those things. Are you staring at your phone right now? if so, you are wasting your most valuable thing. You can get your money back, you cannot get your time back.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "To acheive our goals we must examine the following ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Past is Prologue\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with reviewing some of the core ideas of chemistry focussing on structure and energy. This will not be a review; it will be a **deep dive**. There are things we did not tell you. You are ready at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must first start with a understanding of molecular structure. We will consider the **nature of the chemical bond**. Its not a line on a page, it is an arrangement of electrons and nuclei that form a stable system. The bond and the ability to change it are affected by the system. Changes in structure can affect the energy and therefor the reactivity. **Structure affects reactivity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the effect of structural changes on the electronic arrangement in a bond within a molecule, we will need to consider the quantum nature of system. We will use simple linear combinations of **atomic orbitals** to build graphical models of **molecular orbitals** in small molecules using no math whatsoever. Then we will use simple math to estimate the **energies and electon densities** in $\\pi$ systems and explore the depths of **electron delocalization and aromaticity**. We will then dip our toes into the field of real math without knowing what we are doing by using a **computational chemistry** tool to calculate more exact structure and energies for reactants. itermediates and products. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most obvious ways to show the affect of structure on the energy of a chemical bond is **strain**. A carbon-carbon bond in a 4-membered ring is higher in energy that the same in a 5-membered ring. To explore this idea we will consider the idea of **thermochemistry** and how the relative energies of molecules can be revealed by burning them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seeing Farther\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will move into topics that are familiar but include new ideas for interpreting how structure affects reactivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand how structure influences reactivity, we must understand the path from reactant to product. We will develope a deeper understanding of the **reaction coordinate and the transition state**. We will see how changing the structure of reactants can change the timing of bond changes in the transition state. We will express this via 2-dimensional reaction coordinate diagrams and 3-dimensional reaction **energy surfaces** as we try to get as close to the truth as simple line drawings will permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore **acid/base chemistry** yet again. The fifth time is the charm. The math of acid equilibria will be explored using computational tools and we will leave the world of water behind and experience a place where strong acids show their true power. How can you **measure** the pH of pure sulphuric acid? Physical organic chemistry will show you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and Reactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of physical organic chemistry is the **correlation** of one system with another. Changing structure of benzoic acids changes the pKa value. Can we measure the **electronic effect** of these structure changes using *pK<sub>a</sub>* values as the score? Can we score the **size** of chemical groups by how they affect the rate of a given reaction? Can we then use these scores to study the **mechanism** of unrelated sytems? Yes we can. Free energy changes in one system may relate to free energy changes in another system. With these scoring systems we can see if there is a correlation and draw conclusions from that information. These correlations are called **linear free energy relationships (LFER)** and this idea is the most famous contribution of physical organic chemistry to the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can quantify how structure affects reactivity, perhaps we can quantify how structure affects the activity of drugs. This is the idea of **quatitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR)** and is a majot tool in drug development. Drug companies are investing billions of dollars into the big data of drug discovery. They have now moved on to AI. What's next\n",
    "\n",
    "Even tiny changes can have measurable effects. Changing a hydrogen for another type of hydrogen, deuterium, can have measurable effects on the energy of a reaction. We can investigate a reaction through structural changes that are not really changes. This will be especially useful where slight changes in size may be a deal breaker, such as in enzyme mechanisms. It is often a very easy change to make if the protons involved are even slightly acidic. This idea is called the **kinetic isotope effect** and it is an important tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the details in chemical reaction mechanism through other observations and detective work. There are many **clever methods** and we will explore several options and encounter others as we consider examples of physical organic chemistry.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Examples \n",
    "\n",
    "**We can go anywhere** now. What would you like to investigate? Each year we will create a body of work that future students can build on.  We will begin with biologica;lly relevant **examples of catalysis** and then we will **go wherever you wish**. Would you like to explore physical organic chemistry as it is applied to a **particular problem**? Would you like to **survey the work** of a significant physical organic chemist? We can do anything. And we will record it all in the form of a Jupyterbook and perhaps we might even contribute to wikipedia.\n",
